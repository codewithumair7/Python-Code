# Functions in Python 
# =====================
# A function is a block of code that performs a specific task whenever it is called. 
# In bigger programs, where we have large amounts of code, it is advisable to create or 
# use existing functions that make the program flow organized and neat.

# There are two types of functions:
# ===================================
# - Built-in functions
# - User-defined functions

# Built-in functions:
# These functions are defined and pre-coded in python. Some examples of built-in functions are as follows:
# min(), max(), len(), sum(), type(), range(), dict(), list(), tuple(), set(), print(), etc.


# def calculategmaens(a,b):
#     means = (a*b)/(a/b)
#     print(means)


# a=3
# b=5
# c=9
# d=12
# print("for a and b")
# calculategmaens(a,b)
# print("for c and d")
# calculategmaens(c,d)


# user-defined functions:
# We can create functions to perform specific tasks as per our needs. Such functions are called user-defined functions.

# Syntax:
# def function_name(parameters):
#   pass
  # Code and Statements



def name(fname, lname):
    print("hello",fname,lname)


name("muhammad","Umair")
